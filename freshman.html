        <h2>I,titan</h2>
        <div class="md">
            <p>I, Titan was our first project at Academy. After teams were formed. To learn about the school the I,Titan made us create a tour of the school that explained how Academy works and what makes it different, and perhaps better, than other learning models. It was a group effort, the entire class was divided into small teams (as is usual for all projects), and given 1 space to tour. Together we covered the whole school in depth. My group was assigned the Dome, a space that is usually used when guest speakers come in.</p>

        <h2>Grove to Glass</h2>
        <div class="md">
            <p>Grove to glass was a venture into business. We were told to create a business plan to manufacture, market, and expand a fruit juice product. My group created a juice with a flavourful mixture of oranges and cranberries called "crorangeberry" juice (creative, I know).<br>We marketed to the northeastern united states primarily, and chose to manufacture in pennsylvania sourcing out fruits from Florida and Maine.</p>

        <h2>League of our Own</h2>
        <div class="md">
            <p>League of our Own was a project with more engineering components than previous projects. We created a launching machine that was able to launch tennis balls up to 20 meters (65 feet) to compete in a game. Rather than presenting to a panel or having an open presentation, we went to a high school football field and shot tennis balls at great velocities towards targets. We also created a persona for our team. We wrote a backstory for each of the players and created promotional material for the team.</p>
