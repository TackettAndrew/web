        <h2>True Grit</h2>
        <div class="md">
            <p>In True Grit, we were tasked with creating a game for middle school students that demonstrates the importance of teamwork, cooperation, and foresight. My team did this with an engaging card game that has you stranded in a cold taiga with no hope of rescue. You and your fellow players have to strategize, and cooperate to survive. I realized that it is <strong>very</strong> difficult to create a game that rewards people for their cooperation and punishes them for abandoning their teammates in a way that can be played in a few minutes. I think we did a decent job. Our game didn't do well in rewarding teamwork (i blame the core idea being too simple to simulate that), but we rewarded foresight very well. The game is based on making desicions to change the outcome of an event, so if it didn't reward forsight, we'd need to go to back to the drawing board.<br><br>During the project, I focused my efforts on improving my communication and planning. Communication was an important skill in this project, I ended up leading the team, and proper communication and delegation led to having a working project by the due date. To tie into what we learned in classes, In math we learned about probability to better understand how many descisons can be made in a flowchart of desicions. We created game assets and a website for art, and in English and Debate, we looked at how real people went through hardships to better create our games and make them emulate the intricacies of teamwork and foresight.</p>

        <h2>Really, Really, Cold Case</h2>
        <div class="md">
            <p><em>Really, Really Cold Case</em> was a project that had us create a plausible murder case file for a notable historical figure. My team and I chose to kill Karl Marx. This involved researching Karl Marx's life and find out where he lived, when he lived, and who would want him dead. After we had determined who would kill him, we pieced together an intricate case file with the evidence we had created. We even modeled a <strong>3D printed</strong> knife using CAD! You can find the detailed case file <a href="http://www.karlmarxsociety.weebly.com" target="_blank">here.</a><br><br> During this project, I took more of a following role in team decisions. I improved the most in my communication role, as I created the website using as little words, and as clear sentences as possible. I didn't want the main outlet of information for our case file to be disorganised mess.<br><br>During the project, we learned many practical things that contributed to out project. We learned about logarithms and the laws of cooling in Algebra 2. This obviously contributed a lot of credibility to our evidence. We could prove when the victim was killed based on his body temperature. We looked at the logic behind proving things with mathematical proofs. We asked, "Why?" to everything during the project, and I beleive that added hugely to our Investigation skills. We drew parallels between real investigations and </p>
