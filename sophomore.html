        <h2>True Grit</h2>
        <div class="md">
            <p>In True Grit, we were tasked with creating a game for middle school students that demonstrates the importance of teamwork, cooperation, and foresight. My team did this with an engaging card game that has you stranded in a cold taiga with no hope of rescue. You and your fellow players have to strategize, and cooperate to survive. Personally, during the project, I focused my efforts on improving my communication, planning, and argument construction skills.</p>

        <h2>Really, Really, Cold Case</h2>
        <div class="md">
            <p><em>Really, Really Cold Case</em> was a project that had us create a plausible murder case file for a notable historical figure. My team and I chose to kill Karl Marx. This involved researching Karl Marx's life and find out where he lived, when he lived, and who would want him dead. After we had determined who would kill him, we pieced together an intricate case file with the evidence we had created. We even modeled a <strong>3D printed</strong> knife using CAD!<br>You can find the detailed case file <a href="http://www.karlmarxsociety.weebly.com" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
